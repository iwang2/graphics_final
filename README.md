# Spring, 2018 - Graphics Final Project
Ida Wang, Period 5.

### Implemented Features
1. Lighting commands with only a single light source (`ambient`, `light`, `constants`)
2. New primtive shapes (3 different platonic solids: tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron)
  - all are now centered at their center? centroid? (rotates in place instead of around a vertex)
