# Spring, 2018 - Graphics Final Project
Ida Wang, Period 5.

### Implemented Features
1. Lighting commands with only a single light source (`ambient`, `light`, `constants`).
2. New primtive shapes -> 3 different platonic solids: tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron (I skipped the dodecahedron because the sides are hexagons and I really dont want to write code for hexagons).
    - All are now centered at their center? centroid? (they rotate in place instead of around a vertex).
    - To view these shapes, run `thing.mdl` instead of the `simple_anim.mdl`. Currently the script is set to show an icosahedron, but it can be modified to show a tetrahedron or an octahedron as well.
